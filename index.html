				<br />
				<p>
					I'm a 19 year old first year computer science student at City, University of London.
					I've known how to code for a long time because I learned the basics when I was young, 
					and have improved through countless experiments. Although the majority of my programming
					experience is in computer graphics and low level, I work as a fullstack freelance web developer. 
					Outside of work, I am an experienced skier, I love to cook and play video games.<br />

				<p class="lead text-center">Coding Bootcamp project: Fractal explorer</p>
				<p>
					My project is a Julia fractal explorer. I put it in the 'calm my nerves' category
					because I managed to make it quite smooth and visual. This project demonstrates the use of graphics,
					iteration, input and object orientation. As you can see in the cpu tab, I ended up using
					a multithreaded design for performance reasons, and eventually upgraded that to an OpenGL GPU
					version (as I had previous GLSL knowledge) so that the program can run smoothly. It includes a
					tutorial 'welcome' screen which you can open by pressing T, this lists the extensive controls.
					The basic controls are:<br/><br/>
					<code>w/s</code>: adjust real number.<br/>
					<code>a/d</code>: adjust unreal number.<br/>
					<code>q/e</code>: zoom in / out.<br/>
					<br/>
					You can find it at: <a href="https://github.com/cameron-sim/adbs961">https://github.com/cameron-sim/adbs961</a><br/><br/>
					Here is a short video explaining some of the controls of my program:
